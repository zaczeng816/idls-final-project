            "question": "Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?",
            "reasoning": "Sure! Let's think about Weng's babysitting earnings in a way that relates to everyday situations.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nWeng earns $12 for every hour she babysits. Yesterday, she babysat for 50 minutes. We need to find out how much she earned for those 50 minutes.\n\n### Step 2: Convert Minutes to Hours\nSince Weng's pay is given in hours, we need to convert the 50 minutes into hours. \n\n1 hour = 60 minutes\n\nSo, to find out how many hours 50 minutes is, we divide 50 by 60:\n\n\\[ \\text{Hours} = \\frac{50 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes/hour}} = \\frac{5}{6} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Earnings\nNow, we need to find out how much Weng earns for \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\) of an hour. \n\nWeng earns $12 per hour. So, for \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\) of an hour, her earnings are:\n\n\\[ \\text{Earnings} = 12 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times \\frac{5}{6} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Multiplication\nLet's do the multiplication:\n\n\\[ \\text{Earnings} = 12 \\times \\frac{5}{6} \\]\n\nTo simplify, we can cancel out the 6 in the denominator with the 12 in the numerator:\n\n\\[ \\text{Earnings} = 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nWeng earned $10 for the 50 minutes of babysitting she did yesterday.\n\n### Real-World Example\nImagine you have a lemonade stand and you charge $12 for a full hour of standing and selling lemonade. If you only stand for 50 minutes, how much should you charge? Just like Weng, you would charge $10 for 50 minutes of work. This is because 50 minutes is \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\) of an hour, and \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\) of $12 is $10.\n\nSo, Weng earned **$10** for her 50 minutes of babysitting.",

            "reasoning": "Let's break down the problem using a real-world example to make it easier to understand. Imagine Julie is reading a book that's as thick as a common magazine, like a 120-page magazine.\n\n1. **Understanding the Initial Situation:**\n   - Julie has a 120-page book to read.\n   - Yesterday, she read 12 pages. This is like finishing a short article in the magazine.\n\n2. **Pages Read Today:**\n   - Today, she read twice as many pages as she did yesterday. Since she read 12 pages yesterday, today she read:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 12 = 24 \\text{ pages}\n     \\]\n   - This is like reading two articles that are the same length as the one she read yesterday.\n\n3. **Calculating the Total Pages Read So Far:**\n   - So far, Julie has read:\n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ pages (yesterday)} + 24 \\text{ pages (today)} = 36 \\text{ pages}\n     \\]\n   - This is like reading a small section of the magazine.\n\n4. **Pages Remaining to Read:**\n   - The total number of pages in the book is 120. After reading 36 pages, the number of pages left is:\n     \\[\n     120 - 36 = 84 \\text{ pages}\n     \\]\n   - This is like having most of the magazine left to read.\n\n5. **Reading Half of the Remaining Pages Tomorrow:**\n   - Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow. Half of 84 pages is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{84}{2} = 42 \\text{ pages}\n     \\]\n   - This is like planning to read a significant section of the magazine, but not the entire remaining part.\n\nSo, Julie should read **42 pages** tomorrow. This way, she will continue making good progress through her book, similar to how you might plan to read a large part of a magazine but not all of it in one sitting.",

            "reasoning": "Let's approach this problem step-by-step, first by estimation and rounding, and then by solving it exactly.\n\n### Step 1: Estimation and Rounding\n\n1. **Estimate the time:**\n   - Weng babysat for 50 minutes.

            "question": "James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.  How many pages does he write a year?",
            "reasoning": "Sure! Let's break this down step by step using a real-world example to make it easier to understand.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nJames writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends, and he does this twice a week. We need to find out how many pages he writes in a year.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Weekly Pages\nFirst, let's figure out how many pages James writes in one week.\n\n- James writes a 3-page letter to each friend.\n- He has 2 friends.\n- Each week, he writes to each friend twice.\n\nSo, in one week:\n- Pages per letter: 3 pages\n- Letters per friend per week: 2 letters\n- Total pages per friend per week: \\( 3 \\text{ pages/letter} \\times 2 \\text{ letters} = 6 \\text{ pages} \\)\n- Total pages for 2 friends: \\( 6 \\text{ pages/friend} \\times 2 \\text{ friends} = 12 \\text{ pages} \\)\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Annual Pages\nNow, let's find out how many pages James writes in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year.\n\n- Weekly pages: 12 pages\n- Number of weeks in a year: 52 weeks\n\nSo, in one year:\n- Total pages per year: \\( 12 \\text{ pages/week} \\times 52 \\text{ weeks} = 624 \\text{ pages} \\)\n\n### Step 4: Real-World Example\nImagine James is a pen pal who loves writing letters. Each week, he spends some time writing 3-page letters to his two friends. He does this twice a week to keep in touch regularly. Over the course of a year, all those letters add up to quite a bit of writing!\n\nIf you think about it, writing 624 pages in a year is like writing a small book! That's a lot of effort and dedication to staying connected with his friends.\n\n### Final Answer\nJames writes 624 pages a year.",

            "reasoning": "Let's solve this problem using the estimation and rounding approach first, followed by an exact solution. We'll then compare the two approaches.\n\n### Step 1: Estimation and Rounding\n\n1. **Estimate the pages read yesterday and today:**\n   - Yesterday, Julie read about 10 pages (rounding 12 to 10).\n   - Today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday, so she read about 20 pages (2 * 10).\n\n2. **Estimate the total pages read so far:**\n   - Total pages read = 10 (yesterday) + 20 (today) = 30 pages.\n\n3. **Estimate the remaining pages:**\n   - Total pages in the book = 120.\n   - Remaining pages = 120 - 30 = 90 pages.\n\n4. **Estimate the pages to read tomorrow:**\n   - Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow.\n   - Half of 90 pages is 45 pages.\n\nSo, our estimate is that Julie should read about 45 pages tomorrow.\n\n### Step 2: Exact Solution\n\n1. **Calculate the exact pages read yesterday and today:**\n   - Yesterday, Julie read 12 pages.\n   - Today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday, so she read 2 * 12 = 24 pages.\n\n2. **Calculate the total pages read so far:**\n   - Total pages read = 12 (yesterday) + 24 (today) = 36 pages.\n\n3. **Calculate the remaining pages:**\n   - Total pages in the book = 120.\n   - Remaining pages = 120 - 36 = 84 pages.\n\n4. **Calculate the pages to read tomorrow:**\n   - Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow.\n   - Half of 84 pages is 84 / 2 = 42 pages.\n\n### Step 3: Comparison\n\n- **Estimation Result:** Julie should read about 45 pages tomorrow.\n- **Exact Result:** Julie should read 42 pages tomorrow.\n\nThe estimation method provided a close approximation, but the exact calculation gives the precise number of pages Julie should read tomorrow, which is 42 pages.",
